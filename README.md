🧪 Chemical Calibration Curve Web App

A web application designed to generate and analyze chemical calibration curves for laboratory experiments. The tool allows users to input concentration and absorbance data, automatically calculate the regression line equation and correlation coefficient (R²), and visualize the curve in real time. Built to simplify quantitative chemical analysis and enhance lab data accuracy.

⚙️ Features

Interactive data input and dynamic plotting

Automatic linear regression and R² computation

Exportable results and visualizations

Clean and responsive interface

Real-time updates with optimized performance

🧰 Tech Stack
